Generating config from PHP sources
------------
To generate config of this plugin with custom filters, functions and tags from your Latte extensions, use [contrib/CustomSources](contrib/CustomSources/).

* In `contrib/CustomSources/`, run `composer i`.
* Edit `generate.php` to use your Latte extensions and run it.
* It will generate `latte.xml` which you can store in the `.idea/` directory of your project.
